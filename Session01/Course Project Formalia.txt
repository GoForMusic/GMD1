About the project

The goal of the GMD course project is to create a game for the VIA Arcade machine in XR Lab. The project is comprised of the source code of your project (hosted on Github), as well as a set of blog posts hosted as markdown files on the same Github repository. There must be a total of 6 blog posts (i.e. markdown files), with the following contents:

#1: Roll-a-ball: a brief technical description of how you implemented your first game in the course.
#2: Game Design Document & Milestones; The design document which will guide your game implementation. This blog post also identifies three milestones for the game development process.
#3 + #4 + #5: Development updates for each of the three specified milestones for the game. Highlight technical challenges and refer to implemented mechanics and systems.
#6: A blog post which shows off the final game product and concludes the project.
Each blog post is expected to contain ~1500-3000 characters (including spaces).

 

Deliverables

You must upload a .zip file to WISEflow containing:

(1) A PDF file with:

A link to your GMD project on GitHub (make sure itâ€™s a public repository).
Attach a README to the repository that contains:
A link to a YouTube video demonstration of your game (~2min)
A list of links to all blog posts in your project (each blog post being its own markdown file in the repository)
Sources of any third party assets/code used (this includes any tutorials that you have followed)
Optionally, a link to a playable WebGL build of your game, hosted on GitHub Pages
If working in a group, the GitHub commit messages are used to determine the contributions of each team member. If the commit messages in any way do not reflect the correct distribution of work, this must be addressed in a seperate section of the PDF, including the correct contributions for each team member. In either case, you must include a section in the PDF mapping GitHub usernames with full name and student number.
1-2 pages (one page is ~2400 characters, including spaces) per group member of individual reflections on your contributions to the project. Being concrete and referencing specific code sections is highly encouraged (as are using figures and illustrations, but neither code snippets, figures or illustrations count towards the page limit).
(2) A copy of the source code of your project (avoid including temporary files and build artifacts)
